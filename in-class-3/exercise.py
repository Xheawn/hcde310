# 2. Print a blank line. Then, for each visit, print "long" if minutes is 30 or more, otherwise "short":
#       Ana: short
#    Gus has no "minutes". Use .get() so a missing value counts as 0.

# BONUS (optional): Is Gus really "short"?
# In #2, .get("minutes", 0) labeled Gus "short." But we don't know how long Gus stayed.
# Is "short" honest? What would be a better default, and what would you print for Gus instead?
# Who might be misled if this were a real museum report?
# Write your answers as comments here. Don't change the output above, so check.py still passes.
